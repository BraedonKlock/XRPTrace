# XRPTrace
This program provides a visual tool for tracking XRP flows across XRPL accounts to help investigate stolen or mixed funds.

Right now there is a limit of 300 nodes and a max depth of 4 to prevent the browser from crashing.

## ToDO: 
Set up node JS backend and move xrpl requests and tree to backend to build the full tree with every transaction (no limits).
Allow users to save and upload the tree for quick loading.
